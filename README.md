# A Diagnostic Question Analysis Model based on a Modified Item Response Theory

This repository contains the code for the paper: [A Diagnostic Question Analysis Model based on a Modified Item Response Theory](https://www.atlantis-press.com/proceedings/isemss-22/125981882).

## Abstract

This project leverages **Item Response Theory (IRT)** to predict whether a student can correctly answer a specific diagnostic question based on their learning status and prior answers. We introduce a modified IRT model with discrimination parameters and group classification for improved prediction accuracy. The model is verified on real-world datasets from K-12 mathematics students and shows improvement over baseline models such as k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) and matrix factorization.
